# Network-Intrusion-Detection
Network Intrusion detector, a predictive model that distinguishes between called intrusions, attacks, bad or good connections. 

# Dataset
Security (ACCS) which reflects modern low foot print attacks. UNSW-NB 15 dataset contains a hybrid of real modern normal activities and synthetic contemporary attack behaviors. This dataset has nine types of attack categories, namely, Fuzzers, Analysis, Backdoors, DoS, Exploits, Generic, Reconnaissance, Shellcode and Worms. A few tools and twelve algorithms were used to generate totally 49 features with the class label. This data set is labelled as attack categories (i.e., attack_cat) and label for each record, either 0 if the record is normal and 1 if the record is attack.
